This project implements an AI-powered Agentic Honeypot system designed to engage and analyze potentially fraudulent online messages, including bank-related scams, UPI fraud attempts, and phishing communications.

The system exposes a REST API that accepts incoming messages along with a session identifier. Each message is analyzed internally using urgency-based and financial keywords commonly associated with scam behavior.

When suspicious intent is identified, the honeypot responds with neutral, human-like replies that simulate uncertainty. This approach helps prolong interaction without revealing that detection has occurred, thereby mimicking realistic user behavior.

All scam detection logic and pattern-based analysis are handled internally. To comply with the evaluation platform’s strict response schema requirements, the API returns a minimal JSON response containing only the required fields. Sensitive intelligence and detection signals are intentionally not exposed through the API response.

The solution follows ethical AI principles, avoids impersonation or harmful behavior, and ensures responsible handling of potentially sensitive data while prioritizing security, stealth, and platform compliance.
