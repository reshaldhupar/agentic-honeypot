This project implements an AI-powered Agentic Honeypot system for detecting online scams
such as bank fraud, UPI fraud, and phishing attempts.

The system exposes a REST API that receives incoming messages along with a session ID and
conversation history. Each message is analyzed for scam intent using urgency-based and
financial keywords commonly used by scammers.

When scam intent is detected, an autonomous AI agent is activated. The agent engages the
scammer in a believable, human-like manner without revealing that detection has occurred.
The agent supports multi-turn conversations and adapts its responses dynamically.

During the interaction, the system extracts actionable scam intelligence including UPI IDs,
phone numbers, phishing links, and suspicious keywords using pattern-based analysis.

After sufficient engagement and confirmation of scam intent, the system sends the final
structured intelligence to the mandatory GUVI evaluation endpoint as required by the
hackathon guidelines.

The solution follows ethical AI principles by avoiding impersonation, harassment, or illegal
instructions, and ensures responsible handling of sensitive data.
